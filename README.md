# Home-Loan-Analysis-EDA
**This project aims to analyze bank loan data using Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn) to uncover trends, patterns, and key factors influencing loan approvals. Through univariate and bivariate analysis, the project provides insights into customer demographics, loan status distribution, and risk factors.**

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
  - Loaded and processed loan dataset using Pandas (handling missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions).
  - Used NumPy for numerical operations and statistical calculations.
  - Applied data transformation techniques for better visualization and analysis.
- Univariate Analysis:
  - Explored individual features like income, loan amount,etc.
  - Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create histograms, box plots, and KDE plots for distribution analysis.
- Bivariate Analysis:
  - Visualized correlations using heatmaps, scatter plots, and bar charts in Seaborn.
 
**The analysis provided insights into key factors affecting loan approvals, helping in risk assessment and better decision-making for banks.**
